# PHYSICAL-DESIGN-Workshop
A very useful and informative workshop, where i have gained hands on experience on physical design tools like opentimer, ngspice , magic and sta. It hepled me to understand the flow of design from RTL file to GDSII on tsmc 180nm technology. From this workshop I learnt about SPEF "IEEE 1481-1999" standard,LEF, DEF, SDC files and their significance in the Design flow. Tools used are NGSPICE, MAGIC LAYOUT tool, YOSYS- logic synthesis, GRAYWOLF- placement, QROUTE- maze routing, OPENSTA- timing analysis and SPEF extractor.


**DAY 1** 
    
    a)Description about Fundamentals of PCB and Chip Design.
    
    b)Fundamentals of Packages, PADS, Core and ICs.
    
    c)Introduction to RISC-V architecture.
    
    d)SoC brief taking an Raven chip model with internal explaination about SRAM, ADCs and other Analog IPs.
    
    e) Introduction on design flow and tools on which the design has to be implemented with a goal of processing RTL to GDSII. Tools like 
    
       YOSYS- Logic synthesis
       GREYWOLF- Placement 
       QROUTER- routing
       OPEN_TIMER- Static timing analysis
       MAGIC - layout viewer
       eSPICE - For SPICE simulations with schematically capturing the responses and functionality.
       Qflow - It is provided in order to ease the total design process for complete flow of RTL to GDSII 
       
    f) Invoked the flow using  below git clone for vsdflow :
