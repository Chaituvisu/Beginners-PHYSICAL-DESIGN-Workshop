# Beginners-PHYSICAL-DESIGN-Workshop
A very useful and informative workshop, where i have gained hands on experience on physical design tools like opentimer, ngspice , magic and sta. It hepled me to understand the flow of design from RTL file to GDSII on tsmc 180nm technology. From this workshop I learnt about SPEF "IEEE 1481-1999" standard,LEF, DEF, SDC files and their significance in the Design flow. Tools used are NGSPICE, MAGIC LAYOUT tool, YOSYS- logic synthesis, GRAYWOLF- placement, QROUTE- maze routing, OPENSTA- timing analysis and SPEF extractor.
